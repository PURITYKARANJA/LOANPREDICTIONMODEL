## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**PURITYKARANJA/PURITYKARANJA** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving this loan prediction model by exploring different algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the latest advancements in machine learning, particularly in the domain of financial modeling.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that utilize machine learning to enhance financial decision-making.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with  with refining the loan prediction model to achieve even higher accuracy and exploring techniques to interpret the model's decisions for enhanced transparency.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine learning for loan prediction: How to train and evaluate models, feature engineering, handling imbalanced datasets, and more.
